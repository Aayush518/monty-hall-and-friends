The Monty Hall Problem Simulator is based on a famous probability puzzle that challenges intuitive decision-making. In the classic scenario, a contestant faces three doors: behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two doors are goats. The contestant picks one door, say Door A. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, then opens another door, say Door B, which reveals a goat. The contestant is then given a choice: stick with their original pick (Door A) or switch to the remaining unopened door (Door C). Mathematically, switching doors gives the contestant a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while sticking with the original choice offers only a 1/3 chance. This counterintuitive result is best understood through repeated simulation, which is exactly what our Flask web app offers. Through interactive gameplay, users can simulate multiple rounds, make different choices, and see the outcomes, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the probability dynamics at play.
